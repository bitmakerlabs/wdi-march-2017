== README

This repo contains 4 branches, each of which showing an example of how we would respond to a particular type of AJAX request within Rails.

The 4 branches are:

* master (default non-AJAX form submission)

* html (AJAX request with dataType set to html)

* partial (AJAX request with dataType set to html, with Rails returning a partial instead of inline html)

* json (AJAX request with dataType set to json)

* script (showing Rails' remote: true option to handle AJAX)
